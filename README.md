# Social-Media-Analysis-by-Mrinal-Dev
This is the Python Project related to Social Media Analysis where the work has been done by myself only. 
In this project I have analysed two datasets where first dataset is for Primary analysis on Every Social Media like Whatsapp, Instagram and Facebook and in my second analysis belongs to Sentiment Analysis. For Sentiment Analysis I have choosed the dataset for Tweeter and analyse the dataset for checking the dataset is Neutral, Positive or Negative.
